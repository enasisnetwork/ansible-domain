# Enasis Network Ansible Infrastructure Collection

> This project has not released its first major version.

> This collection is only a placeholder for the moment.

Ansible content for installing and configuring the infrastructure.

Check out this collection on
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/enasisnetwork/domain)
for more information.

## Quick start for local development
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/enasisnetwork/ansible-domain.git
```
Set up the Python virtual environments expected by the Makefile.
```
make -s venv-create
```

### Execute the linters and tests
The comprehensive approach is to use the `check` recipe. This will stop on
any failure that is encountered.
```
make -s check
```
However you can run the linters in a non-blocking mode.
```
make -s linters-pass
```
